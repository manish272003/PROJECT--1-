Contents of the folder

## PreProcessing.ipynb  --- This notebook contains code to data extraction, cleaning, aggregation and test-train splitting etc.,
## Model_2Classes.ipynb --- In this notebook, we implement models to classify normal & diabetic patients
## Model_3Classes.ipynb --- In this notebook, we implement models to classify low, normal & high diabetic levels
## Regression.ipynb     --- We try to implement regression models to predict the exact glucose levels
## ECG_Delineation.ipynb--- This notebook implements a known pipeline to delineate the waves from ECG signal


The results shown in the report are obtained in the first three notebooks.
Regression and delineation didn't get significant results due to the poor quality of the data
